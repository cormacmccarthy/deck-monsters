`
Jinn are not purely spiritual, but also physical in nature, being able to interact in a tactile manner with people and objects and also subject to bodily desires like eating and sleeping. Generally jinn lack individuality and are thought to appear in mists or standstorms, but when they materialize in different forms they may gain individuality. Individual jinn are commonly depicted as monstrous and anthropomorphized creatures with body parts from different animals or human with animalic traits. Their speed, cunning, and amorphous nature makes them difficult to catch a glimpse of against their will.
