# deck-monsters

Spawn monsters, equip them with cards, and send them into the ring to fight. This repo contains the core code for the game engine. Typically it would be hooked into another system via an adapter that instantiates the game object and makes it available in that system. For example, the game was originally written to be played within Slack.
